# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 22, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished an algorithm on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** After 3 months, I came back to FCC, lets see if I can claim the Front End Development Certificate this time.

### Day 1: April 23, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I tried to complete the Pig Latin function in FCC.

**Thoughts:** I know I can do this in Python, because I did it before, but I need to learn more about Regular Expressions to complete this function in JavaScript.

### Day 2: April 24, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Pig Latin function is almost finished

**Thoughts:** I spent a lot of time trying to understand Regular Expressions, the documentation for this one is rather extensive but I managed to understand the basics, using it in the function saved me a lot of time coding and also the code looks simpler when using them.


### Day 3: April 25, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finally finished Pig Latin function, and 3 more.

**Thoughts:** Pig Latin function took me a while, but I finished it. The next functions where a little bit easier.

### Day 4: April 26, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished the Sorted Union function from FCC.

**Thoughts:** This was slightly more difficult than the other ones, I barely got it to work, the code is a mess but it works.

**Links:** [Sorted Union](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/sorted-union)

### Day 5: April 27, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Finished another algorithm on FCC.

**Thoughts:** Being familiar with RegExp helped me a lot in this one and made it really easy. I've been working on the next algorithm which also uses regular expressions but its a little bit trickier, I'll try to complete it tomorrow.

### Day 6: April 29, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Completed another algorithm in FCC.

**Thoughts:** Took me a while but I finished it!

**Links:**[Sum All Fibonacci Numbers](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/sum-all-odd-fibonacci-numbers)


### Day 7: April 30, 2018
**Today's Progress:** The next function is about prime numbers, I havent finished it yet.

**Thoughts:** Well, I've already done this function in Python, is one of the first ones they make you do when you just start learning Python in Codecademy and it was pretty easy, but in Javascript seems to be a little bit harder for me. This would be a lot easier if I knew more about math.

### Day 8: May 1, 2018
**Today's Progress:** The Sum All Primes function is finished!

**Thoughts:** Took me a while but I finished it, there are a lot of lines of code in this function but the other ways to check for prime numbers were too complex for me.

### Day 9: May 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Practiced a bit with some algorithms in Hackerrank

**Thoughts:** I didnt learn anything new today but I practiced a bit with javascript

**Links:** [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-javascript)


### Day 10: May 3, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Today I learned about Error Handling

**Thoughts:** I've been using FreeCodeCamp and Codecademy for a while and this is the first time I hear about this subject, I stumbled upon it on Hackerrank.

### Day 11: May 4, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Continuing with Error Handling, I learned the Throw statement

**Thoughts:** I understand a little bit more about Error handling now, I think its going to be useful when debugging. I also finished another JS exercise. I need to go back to write some code in Python, its been a week since the last time I used it and im forgetting how to do some of the stuff.

### Day 12: May 5, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Learned to use Regular Expresions on MySQL!

**Thoughts:** I was planning on getting back to python but I ended up trying to use RegExp on MySQL. Using them saved me a lot of time (again)

### Day 13: May 6, 2018

**Today's Progress:** More SQL

**Thoughts:** I completed another exercice for MySQL on Hackerrank, at first I thought this was a little bit difficult but it ended up being rather easy

**Links:** [More than 75 Marks](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/more-than-75-marks/problem)


### Day 14: May 7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed 2 javascript functions

**Thoughts:** I've completed 2 functions, they were object related functions, I don't have much experience with objects so I couldn't complete the third functions since it is a little bit harder. 

**Links:**[Conditional Statements](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-conditional-statements), [JS Objects](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/js10-objects)


### Day 15: May 8, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Tried to complete the last FCC exercice I tried last time.

**Thoughts:** I can't find a way to complete this function, I've tried a bunch of stuff but I couln't get the result I wanted. I'll need to check this one later

**Links:** [Smallest common multiple](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/smallest-common-multiple)


### Day 16: May 9, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Practiced with Objects on JS

**Thoughts:** I know a little bit about how objects work in JS but I never worked with them in functions, managed to complete this function but I have to practice a little bit more with objects.

**Links:** [Count Objects](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/js10-count-objects).


### Day 17: May 10, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Practiced a bit with JS Classes.

**Thoughts:** This is a little bit confusing but its not hard, I just have to practice a little bit more

**Links:** [Classes](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/js10-class)


### Day 18: May 11, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Completed the Smallest common multiple function in FCC

**Thoughts:** I've been strugling with this one for the last week and I finally got it working. After this one, I did the next ones, they were way easier

### Day 19: May 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** More practice with JS

**Thoughts:** I came back to a Project Euler problem I was trying to solve back when I was practicing with Python, I couldnt solve it at the moment because I didnt get the hang of how HackerRank works at that time, now that Im more familiar with the environment I came back and solved it.
