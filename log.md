# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Today's Progress:** Finished an algorithm on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** After 3 months, I came back to FCC, lets see if I can claim the Front End Development Certificate this time.

### Day 1: April 23, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I tried to complete the Pig Latin function in FCC.

**Thoughts:** I know I can do this in Python, because I did it before, but I need to learn more about Regular Expressions to complete this function in JavaScript.

### Day 2: April 24, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Pig Latin function is almost finished

**Thoughts:** I spent a lot of time trying to understand Regular Expressions, the documentation for this one is rather extensive but I managed to understand the basics, using it in the function saved me a lot of time code and also the code looks simpler when using them
