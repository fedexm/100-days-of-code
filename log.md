# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 22, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished an algorithm on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** After 3 months, I came back to FCC, lets see if I can claim the Front End Development Certificate this time.

### Day 1: April 23, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I tried to complete the Pig Latin function in FCC.

**Thoughts:** I know I can do this in Python, because I did it before, but I need to learn more about Regular Expressions to complete this function in JavaScript.

### Day 2: April 24, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Pig Latin function is almost finished

**Thoughts:** I spent a lot of time trying to understand Regular Expressions, the documentation for this one is rather extensive but I managed to understand the basics, using it in the function saved me a lot of time coding and also the code looks simpler when using them.


### Day 3: April 25, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finally finished Pig Latin function, and 3 more.

**Thoughts:** Pig Latin function took me a while, but I finished it. The next functions where a little bit easier.

### Day 4: April 26, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished the Sorted Union function from FCC.

**Thoughts:** This was slightly more difficult than the other ones, I barely got it to work, the code is a mess but it works.
