# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 22, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished an algorithm on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** After 3 months, I came back to FCC, lets see if I can claim the Front End Development Certificate this time.

### Day 1: April 23, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I tried to complete the Pig Latin function in FCC.

**Thoughts:** I know I can do this in Python, because I did it before, but I need to learn more about Regular Expressions to complete this function in JavaScript.

### Day 2: April 24, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Pig Latin function is almost finished

**Thoughts:** I spent a lot of time trying to understand Regular Expressions, the documentation for this one is rather extensive but I managed to understand the basics, using it in the function saved me a lot of time coding and also the code looks simpler when using them.


### Day 3: April 25, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finally finished Pig Latin function, and 3 more.

**Thoughts:** Pig Latin function took me a while, but I finished it. The next functions where a little bit easier.

### Day 4: April 26, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished the Sorted Union function from FCC.

**Thoughts:** This was slightly more difficult than the other ones, I barely got it to work, the code is a mess but it works.

### Day 5: April 27, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Finished another algorithm on FCC.

**Thoughts:** Being familiar with RegExp helped me a lot in this one and made it really easy. I've been working on the next algorithm which also uses regular expressions but its a little bit trickier, I'll try to complete it tomorrow.

### Day 6: April 29, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Completed another algorithm in FCC.

**Thoughts:** Took me a while but I finished it!

### Day 7: April 30, 2018
**Today's Progress:** The next function is about prime numbers, I havent finished it yet.

**Thoughts:** Well, I've already done this function in Python, is one of the first ones they make you do when you just start learning Python in Codecademy and it was pretty easy, but in Javascript seems to be a little bit harder for me. This would be a lot easier if I knew more about math.

### Day 8: May 1, 2018
**Today's Progress:** The Sum All Primes function is finished!

**Thoughts:** Took me a while but I finished it, there are a lot of lines of code in this function but the other ways to check for prime numbers were too complex for me.

### Day 9: May 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Practiced a bit with some algorithms in Hackerrank

**Thoughts:** I didnt learn anything new today but I practiced a bit with javascript

### Day 10: May 3, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Today I learned about Error Handling

**Thoughts:** I've been using FreeCodeCamp and Codecademy for a while and this is the first time I hear about this subject, I stumbled upon it on Hackerrank.
